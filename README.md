# The Frood

**Warning: This project is still a work in progress and hasn't been fully verified.**

The Frood is a Pro Micro-like microcontroller module based on a Raspberry Pi RP2040. It is physically and electrically compatible with Elite-C / nice!nano as much as possible.

It follows the [SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18288) pinout with 5 more pins added along the bottom edge (like Elite-C), and USB data lines broken out in the top corners (like nice!nano).

## Features

* Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU
* 4 MB on-board QSPI flash memory
* Mid-mounted USB-C socket and 1.0 mm PCB for low profile
* 500 mA linear regulator
* 500 mA resettable fuse
* Pro Micro / Elite-C / nice!nano compatible pinout

## Availability

The module will be available from [42keebs.eu](https://42keebs.eu/) in September 2022.
