The Frood is a Pro Micro-like microcontroller module based on a Raspberry Pi RP2040. It is physically and electrically compatible with Elite-C / nice!nano as much as possible.

It follows the [SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18288) pinout with 5 more pins added along the bottom edge (like Elite-C), and USB data lines broken out in the top corners (like nice!nano).

## Features

* Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU
* 4 MB on-board QSPI flash memory
* Mid-mounted USB-C socket and 1.0 mm PCB for low total height
* 500 mA linear regulator and resettable fuse
* Pro Micro / Elite-C / nice!nano compatible pinout
* 22 total available digital pins
* 4 analogue pins
* USB D+/D- broken out
* USB VBUS sensing for split keyboard side detection

## Availability

The module will be available from [42keebs.eu](https://42keebs.eu/) in early September 2022.
